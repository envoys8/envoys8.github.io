&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->PassKeeper&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a Windows utility that allows you to keep a list of accounts with usernames, passwords, and notes. This list is stored encrypted.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The utility is freeware and has been available for public download since the mid-90’s. Data are encrypted using the 56-bit &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->DES&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> cipher and stored in an DAT file in the application’s root directory. The size of the application (189 kilobytes) and the data file (~400 bytes/entry) are lightweight and can easily be carried around on any USB flash drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 2016-11-22&lt;/strong>: In 2010 I switched to KeePass, which &lt;a href="https://envoys8.github.io/managing-passwords-across-devices/">works across devices&lt;/a> and provides features such as secure password generation and grouping.
